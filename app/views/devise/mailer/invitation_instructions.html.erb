<p>Hello <%= @resource.email %>,</p>

<p>Someone has invited you to register for a personal account at the
Legume Information System at comparative-legumes.org. Much of the
functionality of LIS is available to all users, and no account is
necessary to use the site. Registration provides a way for us to
support personalization, and in some cases (e.g., curation) 
additional privileges.</p>

<p>You can accept your invitation through the link below.</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Accept invitation', accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token) %></p>

<p>If you don't want to accept the invitation, please ignore this email.<br />
Your account won't be created until you access the link above and fill out the form.</p>
