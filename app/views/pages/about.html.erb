<h1>About the Legume Information System</h1>
<p>The mission of the Legume Information System is to improve the productivity of scientific research across 
Fabaceae by providing comprehensive, up-to-date information bridging the reference species. To serve the community 
better, the site is currently under major redevelopment. The usefulness of the Legume Information System depends 
upon your suggestions for improvement, feedback, and questions. Contact the team at
